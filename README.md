## Learning_Selenium-Java_TestNG
  TestNG with Selenium is a testing framework that offers a range of features and integration with Selenium WebDriver, enables efficient and robust automation testing.

### IMPORTANT FEATURES

  * TestNG provides various annotations like @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, defining the behavior and lifecycle of test methods and test classes.
  * Allows to configure test parameters, test data, and test environment settings using XML-based configuration files .
  * Supports setting test priorities to control the order of test method execution. 
  * Allows defining dependencies between tests to ensure prerequisite tests are executed before dependent tests.
  * Allows to categorize test methods using groups and enables selective execution of tests based on specific groups, allowing for targeted testing of different functionalities or modules.
  * Supports parameterized testing, where we can run a test method multiple times with different sets of test data
  * Helps increase test coverage and reduce code duplication.
  * Integrates with external data sources such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or databases, allowing to perform data-driven testing by executing tests with different data sets.
  * provides a wide range of built-in assertions, allowing to validate expected outcomes during test execution. 
  * Assertions help in performing verifications and provide detailed failure messages in case of test failures.
  * Generates detailed HTML test reports that summarize test execution results, including passed and failed tests, execution times, and stack traces for failures. 
  * Enables to create and manage test suites, which are collections of test classes or test methods, providing a convenient way to group and execute tests.
  * Supports data providers, which allow to supply test data dynamically to test methods at runtime and enhance flexibility in testing.
